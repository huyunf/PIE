PROB LEM Write two conversion routines. The first routine converts a string
to a signed integer. You may assume that the string contains only digits and the
minus character ('-'), that it is a properly formatted integer number, and that the
number is within the range of an int type. The second routine converts a signed
integer stored as an int back to a string.
